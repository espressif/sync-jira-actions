## Project Organization

- **Project Configuration:** The setup for both production and development dependencies is outlined in the `pyproject.toml` file. This centralized approach simplifies dependency management.

- **Automatic `requirements.txt`:** Changes to dependencies are automatically reflected in the `requirements.txt` file, derived from `pyproject.toml`. Direct modifications should be avoided; instead, update `pyproject.toml`.

- **Commit Standard:** Adherence to the Espressif standard for Conventional Commits ensures consistency in commit messages. Tools like pre-commit hooks and the integrated PR linter DangerJS assist in formatting commit messages appropriately, a key factor for `commitizen` to auto-generate the changelog.

## Code and Testing

- **Code Style and Structure:**

  - **Pre-Commit Hooks:** Install pre-commit hooks in this repository using the `pre-commit install` command.

  - **Readable Code Structure:** Structure your code in a readable manner. The main logic should be in the default rule function, with implementation details in helper functions. Avoid nested `if` statements and unnecessary `else` statements to maintain code clarity and simplicity.

  - **Remove Debug Statements:** Remove any development debug statements from your files.

- **Automated Tests:** The tests should cover all typical usage scenarios as well as edge cases to ensure robustness.

- **Testing Tool:** It is recommended to run `pytest` frequently during development to ensure that all aspects of your code are functioning as expected.

## Documentation and Maintenance

- **Changelog:** `CHANGELOG.md` is generated automatically by `commitizen` from commit messages. Not need to update `CHANGELOG.md` manually. Focus on informative and clear commit messages which end in the release notes.

- **Documentation:** Regularly check and update the documentation to keep it current.

- **PR Descriptions and Documentation:** When contributing, describe all changes or new features in the PR (Pull Request) description as well as in the documentation. When changing the style to the output style, attach a thumbnail after the change.

## Development and Local Testing

1. **Clone the Project**

- Clone the repository to your local machine using:

  ```sh
  git clone <project_clone_url>
  ```

2. **Set Up Development Environment:**

- Create and activate a virtual environment:

  ```sh
  python -m venv venv && source ./venv/bin/activate
  ```

  or:

  ```sh
  virtualenv venv && source ./venv/bin/activate
  ```

- Install the project and development dependencies:
  ```sh
  pip install -e '.[dev]'
  ```

3. **Testing Your Changes:**

- Before submitting a pull request, ensure your changes pass all the tests. You can run the test suite with the following command:

```sh
pytest
```
